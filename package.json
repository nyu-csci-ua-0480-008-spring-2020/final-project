Seeing as the entire world is currently undergoing quarantine conditions, we were inspired to create a tool that would help the community adapt to these social changes by creating a routine. We envisioned a platform that would encourage everyone to 1) help themselves through developing healthy & enjoyable habits 2) help others by contributing to those businesses/hospitals/vulnerable populations in need.",
